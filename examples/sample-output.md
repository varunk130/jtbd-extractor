### 💜 Emotional Jobs

## Comparison to Existing Personas

*How these jobs relate to your current understanding:*

- **Confirms:** "Overloaded PM" persona's core pain around status reporting and multi-project juggling is strongly validated. 11 of 12 interviewees mentioned this unprompted.
- **Expands:** Emotional and social jobs were entirely missing from persona docs. The anxiety around executive visibility and the desire for recognition are significant drivers — possibly more than functional gaps.
- **Contradicts:** Persona docs assumed "Engineering Lead" primarily cares about sprint velocity. Interviews reveal they care more about **early warning on cross-team dependencies** than internal team speed.

## Top Opportunities

### 1. Auto-Generated Status Intelligence
**Job:** When preparing for a weekly leadership sync, I want to see cross-team status at a glance, so I can report progress without chasing people for updates.  
**Opportunity Score:** 15  
**Why Underserved:** Current tools require manual updates that are always stale. PMs spend 2–3 hours/week compiling status from Slack, docs, and tickets.  
**Desired Outcomes:**
- Status is always current without anyone manually updating it
- I can generate an exec-ready summary in under 60 seconds
- Changes since last week are highlighted automatically

**Solution Space:** AI-generated status rollups from activity signals (commits, ticket updates, Slack threads, doc edits). Auto-drafted weekly summary with anomaly detection.

---

### 2. Dependency Impact Radar
**Job:** When a project timeline shifts, I want to instantly see downstream impact on dependencies, so I can re-prioritize before things break.  
**Opportunity Score:** 14  
**Why Underserved:** Dependency tracking exists but is manual and static. No tool proactively alerts when a slip in Team A creates a cascade risk for Teams B, C, D.  
**Desired Outcomes:**
- Alerted within hours (not days) when a dependency is at risk
- Can see the full blast radius of a delay in one view
- Can simulate "what if this slips 2 weeks?" scenarios

**Solution Space:** Dynamic dependency graph with real-time health signals. Automated risk propagation alerts. Scenario modeling for timeline changes.

---

### 3. Historical Project Intelligence
**Job:** When scoping a new initiative, I want to reference how similar past projects actually went, so I can give realistic estimates instead of guessing.  
**Opportunity Score:** 14  
**Why Underserved:** Retrospectives happen but insights aren't structured or searchable. Estimation debt compounds across quarters.  
**Desired Outcomes:**
- Can search "projects like this" and see actual timelines vs. estimates
- Pattern recognition: "projects with 3+ team dependencies typically take 40% longer"
- New team members can learn from institutional history

**Solution Space:** Structured project archives with tagging. AI-powered estimation assistant trained on your org's actual delivery data.

## Feature Request Translation

| What They Asked For | The Real Job |
|---|---|
| "Add a dashboard" | Know if I'm on track without manually compiling status |
| "Gantt chart view" | See dependency chains and identify cascade risks at a glance |
| "Export to PDF" | Share progress with executives who won't log into our tool |
| "Slack integration" | Get alerted about risks in my existing workflow, not another app |
| "More chart types" | Tell a compelling, data-backed story to justify my team's work |
| "API access" | Connect project data to our BI tools so leadership trusts the numbers |
| "Templates for projects" | Stop reinventing the wheel and learn from what worked before |
| "Better search" | Find the decision history for any deliverable without archaeology |
| "Mobile app" | Check status during back-to-back meetings without opening a laptop |
| "Permissions/roles" | Share the right level of detail with each audience without manual filtering |

## Recommendations

1. **Prioritize auto-generated status intelligence** — it's the #1 opportunity and directly addresses the most emotionally charged pain point (executive anxiety). Quick wins: AI-drafted weekly summaries from existing activity data.

2. **Build the dependency impact radar as a differentiator** — competitors have dependency tracking, but nobody does proactive cascade alerting well. This is a moat opportunity.

3. **Don't build a Gantt chart** — the underlying job is about dependency visibility, not the specific visualization. A dynamic dependency graph with health signals would serve the job better.

4. **Surface emotional jobs in your marketing** — "Sleep better knowing nothing's falling through the cracks" will resonate more than "Track tasks across teams."

## Suggested Next Steps

- [ ] Update `personas.md` with emotional and social jobs discovered
- [ ] Validate opportunity scores with quantitative survey (n=100+ PMs)
- [ ] Run a design sprint on "auto-generated status intelligence" — highest opportunity, clearest solution space
- [ ] Add "dependency impact" questions to next round of user interviews
- [ ] Share Feature Request Translation table with engineering to reframe backlog items

⚠️ **Note:** Importance and satisfaction scores are estimated from 12 interviews + 47 NPS responses. Directionally strong but validate with a larger quantitative sample before making major prioritization decisions. Emotional and social job scores have lower confidence (fewer direct data points) — consider dedicated interview questions in next research round.
